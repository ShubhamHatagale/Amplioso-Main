Your package selection choice is only driven by how many employees you wish to benefit from 360-degree feedback during the year. You can select packages that cater to 1-10, 11-100, up to 500, up to 5000, or 5000+ employees. Our prices are aggressively competitive and offer a fantastic value. Additionally, as we’re getting started, we’ve been told that our introductory/ beta pricing is a steal.

Within this year, you are able to assign and launch surveys for up to the number of employees that your subscribed package allows for. Surveys can be launched to match your internal quarterly, semi-annual, or annual cycle for those assigned employees. During sign up, you don’t have to know the names or details of the employees, they can be signed up at any time during the year.

You can upgrade to any package as your business expands or as you intend to include more of your employees to the benefits of Amplioso. For the upgrade, all you have to do is pay the fee differential between your package and the upgrade for the remainder of the year previously enrolled for.

At the end of each year, your subscription is renewed unless this feature is turned off. The biggest benefit of auto-renewal is that you lock in your annual fee increase to only a low 5% each year. This auto-renewal feature gives you maximum predictability of how your talent investments will look year on year – without the hassle of needing to remember renewing each year.

This is generally a great option for organizations who want to make significant talent investments upfront from budgets that are currently available. There are significant financial benefits for the organization in doing this – so everyone wins. Fees for 2 years paid upfront are just 1.8X year 1 fees and fees for 3 years paid upfront are 2.5X year 1 fees. No fee increases. All locked in.

Anonymized feedback scores from surveys taken for your employees may be continued to be maintained in aggregate for our norms database for future benchmarking purposes.

Internal benchmarks are easy – they are scores from within your organization. For external benchmarks, we try and provide scores that are most meaningful to your industry and size of business. We start with our full database of benchmarks and as more granularity becomes available, we share it. We will always provide full disclosure for you so that you know what your people are being compared against.
